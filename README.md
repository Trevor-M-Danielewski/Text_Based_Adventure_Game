# Text-Based Adventure Game

## Description:

This was a program that I developed along side another student, Noah Glorioso, and was our final project for our Introduction to Computer Science I class in the fall semester of 2023.

Welcome to the Text-Based Adventure Game, an immersive journey into a mysterious dungeon filled with challenges and secrets. This program offers a classic text adventure experience, allowing users to navigate through the dungeon, interact with diverse objects, and encounter intriguing characters.

### Key Features:

- **Exploration:** Move between rooms to uncover the hidden corners of the dungeon.
  
- **Item Interaction:** Pick up items and strategically use them to unlock doors and overcome obstacles.
  
- **Combat and Challenges:** Face enemies and engage in battles as you progress through the game. Be cautious - the outcome can determine your fate!

- **Character Interaction:** Communicate with characters in the game to gain hints, clues, and unravel the storyline.

- **Game Endings:** The adventure concludes when you successfully escape the dungeon or meet an unfortunate demise. Your choices matter!
